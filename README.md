This repository hosts the required files to run a histogram program coded in C language. The program is capable of scanning file types specified as a ‘.hist’ file and ‘.txt’ file which contain numerical and alphabetical data, respectively. The program can display the data in both horizontal and vertical histogram formats.

## Features
- **File Type Support**: The program supports `.hist` files for numerical data and `.txt` files for alphabetical data.
- **Histogram Display**: Data can be displayed in horizontal and vertical histogram formats.
- **User Input**: The program prompts the user to select the file type and the histogram display format.

- ## File Types
- **.hist Files**: These files should contain numerical data, each number on a new line.
- **.txt Files**: These files should contain alphabetical data, each letter on a new line.

## Example Files
- `example.hist`: Contains a set of numerical data for testing.
- `example.txt`: Contains a set of alphabetical data for testing.
