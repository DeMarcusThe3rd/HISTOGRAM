Histogram Module
This folder contains the source code and header files necessary for generating and displaying histograms in C. These files are part of a larger project but can be compiled and run independently for testing and development purposes.

Files
main.c: The main entry point for the histogram module. This file contains the main function, which orchestrates the reading of input data, calls functions to process this data, and displays the resulting histogram.
histogram.h: Header file with function declarations and macros for histogram generation. It defines the interface for the functions implemented in histogram.c.
histogram.c: Implementation file for the functions declared in histogram.h. This file contains the logic for generating the histogram, including functions for processing input data and creating the visual representation of the histogram.
File Descriptions
main.c
The main.c file is responsible for:

Initializing the program.
Reading input data from the user or a file.
Calling the necessary functions to process the data and generate the histogram.
Displaying the histogram to the user.
The workflow in main.c is as follows:

It starts by setting up necessary variables and reading the input data.
It then calls functions from histogram.c to process this data.
Finally, it prints the histogram to the console.
histogram.h
The histogram.h file contains:

Function prototypes for the functions implemented in histogram.c.
Macros and constants used throughout the histogram module.
This file serves as the interface between main.c and histogram.c.

histogram.c
The histogram.c file contains the core logic for the histogram module:

Data Processing Functions: These functions take the raw input data and process it to determine the frequency of each data range.
Histogram Generation Functions: These functions use the processed data to generate a histogram, which is then returned to main.c for display.
The main functions typically found in histogram.c include:

void processData(int *data, int size): Processes the input data to calculate the frequency distribution.
void generateHistogram(int *frequency, int size): Generates the histogram based on the frequency distribution.
